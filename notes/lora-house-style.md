# House-style LoRA — build log (started 2026-08-26)

Goal: one house art style across campaigns, trained on the owner's own 2024 D&D books.
Personal use only; the trained LoRA and the training corpus stay off the public repo.

## Decision: FLUX.1-dev, not FLUX.2-dev

FLUX.2-dev is 32B — its transformer alone is ~30 GB at fp8 and the Mistral-3 text encoder is
another ~24 GB. They cannot coexist on one 32 GB card: peak transient is 32.94 GB against the
5090's 31.84 GB usable, so Windows pages through system RAM and the step rate collapses to
**277 s/it** (a 400-step run takes 30+ hours; our ~3000-step style run would take ~10 days).
See github.com/genno-whittlery/flux2-dual-gpu-lora, which exists specifically to work around this.

FLUX.1-dev (12B) trains comfortably on the 5090 and is what ai-toolkit actually ships configs for
(`train_lora_flux_24gb.yaml`; there is **no** FLUX.2 example config).

Trade-off accepted: the LoRA applies to `final` + `refine` modes, not `scene` mode. That is fine —
`final` currently has *no* style mechanism at all (it renders from the prompt alone), and a style
LoRA also turns low-denoise `refine` into the style-unification pass the owner asked for. `scene`
mode keeps using reference anchoring (Morgash + Gren as refs 2–3), which is already proven.

If scene-mode style is wanted later: rent an 80 GB card for an afternoon, train there, run the
resulting LoRA locally (inference already streams the 35.5 GB fp8 checkpoint fine).

## Corpus (133 images) — `~/Desktop/lora-corpus-dnd2024/prepared/`

PHB 65 · MM 36 · DMG 18 · Heroes of Faerûn 14. Ravenloft deliberately skipped (horror art
direction). PHB-led on purpose: small-corpus LoRAs leak *content* along with style, and we want
the leak to be humanoids-in-gear, not monster scales.

**Only `assets/journal-art/` is usable.** The `portraits/` and `subjects/` directories in every
book module are token cutouts floating on white — no background, no composition, useless for style.

Three prep steps, all necessary (see the artifacts they remove):

1. **Alpha margins** — 69 of 139 plates ship with transparent feathered edges. Cropped to the
   opaque bounding box, then composited on white.
2. **Gold frames** — 35 plates (subclass/domain singles, some MM group plates) have a decorative
   gold border. Detected by locating the gold rule via a colour mask and row/column hit counts,
   then cropped to its interior. Left in, these teach the model to paint plate borders around
   everything — the training-data twin of the cookbook's "never say book art / cover / poster" rule.
3. **White-heavy vignettes** — 6 plates were figures floating on page white with no croppable
   margin. Moved to `excluded/`.

Captions are `.txt` alongside each image. **All 133 were written by looking at the image** — a
first filename-derived pass was scrapped because it under-described.

The rule that matters: captions describe **content only** (species, figure count, gear, setting,
action) and deliberately say nothing about lighting, mood, palette, or brushwork. Anything named in
a caption is attributed to those words instead of to the trigger, so the style has to stay
*undescribed* in order to land on `dnd24art`. Subject-intrinsic colour ("green robes", "a red
dragon", "bone-white skin") is content and stays; image-level colour ("bathed in golden light") is
style and is banned.

Why the filename pass was not good enough: 114 of 133 captions were three-to-nine words naming only
a class or concept, so every undescribed detail leaked into the trigger. `phb-oath-of-vengeance`
was captioned "a paladin, oath of vengeance" for a plate that actually shows *a green dragonborn in
dark red-gemmed plate with a spectral blue dragon rising behind* — all of which was being taught to
`dnd24art`. Looking at the images also caught filenames that simply lie: `mm-ghouls` shows one
ghoul, `dmg-npc-healer` shows a spellcaster over a stone slab and no patient, `hof-white-worm` is a
winged dragon, and `phb-barbarian` / `mm-ogres` / `phb-eldritch-knight` are cropped too tightly to
determine species.

Final state: min 4 words, median 20, mean 19; zero sparse captions, zero style-word leaks.

## Environment

- Trainer: `D:\Workbench\LOCAL\LocalAI\ai-toolkit` (ostris/ai-toolkit), venv at `ai-toolkit\venv`.
- Base weights: `black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev`, diffusers format, ~32 GB, in the HF cache.
  License-gated: the owner accepted the FLUX.1-dev Non-Commercial License and ran `hf auth login`
  themselves (weights are non-commercial; **outputs** are explicitly fine for personal and
  commercial use).
- Rebuild with `setup-venv.sh`.

### Install gotchas (both cost a full failed run)

- **Never use uv-managed CPython here** — Windows Application Control blocks its `_ctypes` DLL.
  Use `py -3.13 -m venv`. Same policy breaks `uv tool install` console-script trampolines.
- `scipy==1.12.0` (pinned in `requirements.txt`) has no cp313 wheel and tries to compile. Install
  `requirements_base.txt` plus `scipy>=1.14` instead.
- `torchaudio` is imported by `toolkit/config_modules.py` but is not in the requirements; install it
  from the same cu128 index as torch.

## Runtime notes

- **Stop ComfyUI before training** — it holds ~23.8 GB of VRAM. `artificer-status` shows the queue;
  relaunch with `scripts/launch-comfyui.ps1`.
- Desktop cost with the single 4K monitor on the 5090 is only ~1 GB, leaving ~30.4 GB.

## Benchmark results (2026-08-26, RTX 5090, rank 32, batch 1, 1024/768/512 buckets)

| | bf16 (`quantize: false`) | fp8 (`quantize: true`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Peak VRAM | 32,024 MiB / 32,607 (98%) | **23,108 MiB (71%)** |
| Step time | 10.5–12.2 s/it | **1.65–2.21 s/it** |
| 4,000 steps | ~12 h | **~2.4 h** |

**fp8 wins outright.** bf16 did not OOM, but only because Windows paged the overflow to system
RAM — the same thrash that rules out FLUX.2, just milder; that paging *is* the 5× slowdown.

Decisive extra argument: **inference is already fp8** (`final`/`refine` load
`flux1-dev-fp8.safetensors`). Training bf16 and deploying fp8 would be a train/inference precision
mismatch. fp8 training matches deployment, so it is the more correct choice here, not a compromise.

"Longer and better" therefore gets spent on **more steps and variant comparison** rather than on
precision — a well-tuned fp8 LoRA beats one blind mistuned bf16 run.

## Overnight plan (~8 h, sequential, `run-overnight.sh`)

| Run | Steps | LR | Rank |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 4000 | 1e-4 | 32 |
| B | 5000 | 5e-5 | 32 |
| C | 4000 | 1e-4 | 64 |

Checkpoints every 500 steps are kept, so step-count comparison is free — no variant needed for it;
the runs vary only what checkpoints cannot give us (LR and rank). Each run also samples 5 images
every 500 steps using real campaign subjects (Morgash's tusks, Gren's silver-white spellfire, the
autumn temple, a firelit hobgoblin cave, Thomas's sunburst shield), so curation in the morning is
visual — same as every other judgement call in this pipeline.

**Stop ComfyUI before launching** and leave it down for the duration.

Run C was swapped mid-night from rank 64 to **rank 16** on the evidence below (leak is the failure
mode, so less capacity is the informative experiment, not more). Its config *filename* still says
`r64` — deliberate: the runner is a live bash process that reads itself as it executes, so only the
file contents were changed. Output folder reads `dnd24art-C-lr1e4-r16`.

## Run A findings (lr 1e-4, rank 32, 4000 steps — 2h21m, 8 ckpts @ 327 MB, 45 samples)

The style transferred: crisp confident linework, saturated colour, worn metal with real surface
damage — recognisably the 2024 sourcebook look rather than generic FLUX.

Three defects, all pointing the same way (**the LoRA applies too strongly**):

1. **Parchment leak.** Prompts that do NOT name a background collapse to a flat page-coloured field,
   sometimes with a border edge, and a signature artifact at ~1000 steps. Cause: compositing the 69
   transparent-margin plates onto **white** during prep. Cropping tighter, or onto neutral grey,
   would have been better — fix this at the data level before any retrain.
   **Not fatal:** prompts that DO name a setting render full environments (the ruined-temple and
   misty-forest samples both did). The house portrait spec always names a background, so this is
   mostly self-mitigating.
2. **Overrides prompt content** — ignored "bone-white skin" (came out tan) and produced upward
   walrus tusks (the cookbook's known "tusk is a trap word" failure).
3. **Cartooning on faces** (owner's read), and one sample looked "like a bad meshy AI model".

**Do not judge faces from the sample grid.** Samples are 20-step, guidance 4, 1024px previews with
no upscale — a preview setting that punishes faces specifically while flattering landscapes. Also,
"elderly wizard casting magic" is an enormous base-model attractor, so FLUX's own prior may be what
shows through there rather than the LoRA.

**Morning evaluation must be done through the real pipeline**, not the previews: render the
candidate through `final` mode at full steps + the upscale tail, at several LoRA strengths, and put
it beside the already-approved staged portraits. Three dials to search, not one: **which run ×
which checkpoint depth × what LoRA strength** (strength is continuous at inference — an
over-cartooning LoRA at 1.0 is often correct at 0.6–0.7, so a "too strong" checkpoint is not
disqualified).

It is fine for this to lose. Reference anchoring (Morgash + Gren as refs 2–3) already works.
